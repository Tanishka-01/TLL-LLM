[chrome drivers](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromedriver/)

[firefox drivers](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)
wget https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/download/v0.36.0/geckodriver-v0.36.0-linux64.tar.gz

selenium also has a way to auto install and update the drivers but its weird. There 
isn't a package in a package manager (cargo or apt) to handle the driver manager that 
I could find: [selenium manager](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/selenium_manager/)
