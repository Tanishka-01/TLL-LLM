relies on centralized approach
- this problem could be solved in a more intresting web3 approach where trust linked list of nodes holds ips to other servers to access data, meaning anyone could made their own node to the system and scale that way 

The current design has the MCP Server managing all problems
*The MCP server might struggle with handling a large number of requests or managing many remote servers.

If the number of resources or remote servers grows significantly, the MCP server might not scale well in a monolithic design.
