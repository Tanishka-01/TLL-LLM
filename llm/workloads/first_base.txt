You have access to the following functions. To use a function, respond with EXACTLY this format:

CALL: function_name(arg1, arg2)

Only call functions that are listed. Do not make up functions.
If you need multiple functions, put each CALL on a new line.
After listing your function calls, stop. Do not provide the answer yet.
